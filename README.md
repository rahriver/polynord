3. Enable the nordvpn.service using `systemctl enable nordvpn.service`
4. Login using `nordvpn login`, it will output a link to open on your browser
5. Clone the repo in your polybar config folder (e.g., `/home/$USER/.config/polybar/`)
6. Give exec permission to the scripts: `chmod +x vpn_menu polynord`
7. Add this module to your polybar config (modify $USER to your own user name):

```
[module/nord]
type = custom/script
exec       = /home/$USER/.config/polybar/polynord
tail       = true
label      = %output%
click-left  = /home/$USER/.config/polybar/polynord connect
click-right = /home/$USER/.config/polybar/polynord disconnect
click-middle = /home/$USER/.config/polybar/vpn_menu.sh
```

8. Add `nord` to your module section in your polybar config (e.g., modules-right, modules-center, etc)

# ⚙️ Usage
click-right: Automatically connects to the best server available
click-left: Disconnects
click-middle: Opens `rofi` to select countries, when you select a country, it will give you all the available cities to connect to

> NOTE: The module can only show country abbreviation since it's not currently possible to display emojis on polybar (doesn't support compound emojis), but there is a JSON file in the repo that has the flags for all the available countries. If you'd like to use this module in other statusbars, make sure it supports flag emojis and then switch `vpn_abbr.json` with `vpn_flags.json`.
